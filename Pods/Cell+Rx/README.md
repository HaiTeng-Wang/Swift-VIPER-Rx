Cell+Rx
===========

**Cell+Rx** provides a similar API to [NSObject+Rx](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/NSObject-Rx) but for cells who are reused along the way.

I found myself creating `DisposeBag`s that were reset on the `prepareForReuse()` function which was pretty repetitive.

Instead of adding a new property to every cell, use this library to add it for you, to any subclass of `UITableViewCell` or `UICollectionViewCell`.

```swift
thing
  .bindTo(otherThing)
  .addDisposableTo(rx_reusableDisposeBag)
```

It'll work just like a property: when the instance is deinit'd, the `DisposeBag` gets disposed. It will also reset whenever the cell is reused by detecting `prepareForReuse()` calls. It's also a read/write property, so you can use your own, too.

Installing

####CocoaPods

This works with RxSwift version 2, which is still prerelease, so you've gotta be fancy with your podfile.

```ruby
pod 'Cell+Rx'
```

And that'll be ðŸ‘Œ
